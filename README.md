#### So what is members only?

Members Only is a project that I did for the NodeJS section in The Odin Project. The premise is that anyone who signs up for the website can write an anonymous post, but cant see when the other messages were made or who they were sent by. _But_ if you join the club with a "Secret" password, the you can see the time as well as who wrote it!

The whole idea is to practice authentication skills and cleaning up database skills as well! I learned a lot about how to encrypt passwords, use passport.js, show different formats for different people (for example I can delete people's messages with my login), etc.

### Objectives

- [x] Think about how I want to setup the database: usernames, passwords, status
- [x] Connect to MongoDB with project skeleton
- [x] Sign-up form where passwords are crypted with `bycrypt`, confirm password, make sure usernames dont repeat
- [x] Add a page where you can join the club with a secret passcode
- [x] Add login form with passport.js
- [x] Make sure that only users cana create messages
- [x] Correctly display for users, users with membership, and admin view.

### What I learned and What I would do differently

- This project took a while just due to being busy with school and so on. But I had a lot of fun completing it. I feel as if I understand authentication pretty well at this point and I am getting a lot more comfortable with the MVC pattern! I should have added an admin section instead of checking the username for deleting messages but I got a little lazy with that. Overall, very satisfied with my result!
